Flash back to 1944, when this whole “computer” thing was pretty new.

Harvard computer scientists working on the Mark I electromechanical computer — the early supercomputer that helped Manhattan Project scientists simulate the effects of an atomic bomb — had started to call errors in their software “bugs.”

That was a term borrowed from electrical engineers “to refer to hard-to-find physical defects that hindered the operation of an electric device,” according to the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Artifacts.

In 1947 a now-legendary bug made its way into the Mark II supercomputer. A moth got into a mechanical relay and got crushed, jamming the system.

Pioneering computer scientist **Grace Hopper** removed it and taped the troublesome moth into the team’s operational logbook with the caption “First actual case of bug being found”.

She even illustrated the different kind of bugs a programmer might encounter.
